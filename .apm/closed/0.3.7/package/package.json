It'll pop open a panel similar to the command palette and will\ngive you possible completions as you type paths. It'll also expand ~ for you.\n\n**Opening Closed**\n* `cmd-ctrl-p` (`alt-ctrl-p` on Linux): Open a file.\n\n**While In Closed**\n* `enter` (or `tab`): If the current selection is a file then open it otherwise complete\n  the current path.\n* `cmd-enter` (`ctrl-enter` on Linux): Open current path. If it's an existing\n  directory, open in a new atom window, otherwise create a file.\n\n![Closed](http://raynes.me/hfiles/goodclosed2.png)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/Raynes/closed/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/Raynes/closed","_id":"closed@0.3.7","_shasum":"4d519f00c8c87272594435bb0b032f2ad5cc81e6","_resolved":"file:../d-115525-11052-1fc96d8/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115525-11052-1fc96d8/package.tgz"}
