Originally imported from [r.tmbundle](https://github.com/textmate/r.tmbundle).

## Unmaintained

This package is no longer maintained. All issues and PRs have been and will be closed. This is remaining published in the Atom package repository so that people can find it to fork it and create their own version. Hopefully one of them will create a new maintained version.
